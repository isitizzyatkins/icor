# ISAAC's Casualties of Rhythm
a 4 key sm file collection for use in keyboard rhythm games. low difficulty ceiling, maximum fun, updated whenever i feel like it. think of them like dance choreography, but for your fingers. highly replayable and enjoyable according to me, and i am always right.

all charts are separated by rhythm tiers that can be downloaded and played separately. the categories do not represent raw difficulty, they represent rhythmic complexity. if that doesn't make sense, start with tier 1 and move up from there if that's too easy or too boring for you. 

download, extract, then place into the songs folder of any game that will accept .sm files. (stepmania files). wow, it's so easy.

please note that these are made for normal people who do not want to develop tendonitis or any chronic wrist injuries while playing a keyboard rhythm game. if you decide these are too far beneath you to enjoy, good for you. i'll see you in a few years when your wrists give out.

these charts are made for fun and are released freely into the wild. i do not claim ownership over any of the music or backgrounds used. as if that wasn't already obvious.
